        <p>HealthGuardian is a platform intended for hospital patients who require assistance with their medical financial needs. This app caters to patients who are <strong>low-income or use public health insurance companies</strong> to get more information about their medical finances. <strong>"Bandy"</strong> is HealthGuardian’s helper who guides and educates their users about medical financial terms. With this app, patients can easily pay off their medical bills in one centralized location, and access a dedicated page for financial resources to assist with their medical expenses.</p>
        <p>After experiencing a stressful situation for an unexpected situation, I am hoping people will no longer deal with the hassle of <strong>finding resources </strong> to help alone. There’s a lot I need to improve on this app, but it is a start to help relieve those who went through the same experience. Although there are only a few health insurance companies on this app, I hope to expand to different providers and hospitals.</p>
